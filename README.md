This is a class project in which I Implemented the cryptographic logic for a secure messaging platform, focusing on achievingintegrity, confidentiality, and deniability. Utilized a protocol akin to Signal's, incorporating a triple Diffie-Hellman key exchange and developing a double ratchet algorithm to enable handling of out-of-order message delivery while maintaining the critical aspect of forward secrecy.
